This project was initially completed using div tags and tables, in other words, the old fashioned way. And then we got some new tech: flex and semantic tags. The combination of these two concepts revolutionized web site development and made possible a faster, more intuitive, and dare I say more fun way of developping HTML and styling with CSS.

I had done most of the changes outside of any reposititory or version control system, even though I had uploaded my initial code to Github.

So I initialzed a git repository on my local machine, downloaded the new flex styled and semantically tagged html code from the server, and updated the old code here on Github by pushing.

I am considering creating a branch containing the old code for study purposes - sort of a museum for the old code. If I do I may name the new branch with the old code "Pre-Flex," or "Non-semantic." We'll see.
